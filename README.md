# TianFly
An open source hardware solution for drone navigation,which is based on Fast-drone-250

## Overview
The autonomous drone has a wheelbase of 3.5 inches, with material costs around 4000 RMB(if you live in China), and consists entirely of ready-made components. It features propeller guards and a top-mounted battery. The frontal view is a regular triangular structure, which effectively protects valuable sensors and computing units, significantly reducing the costs associated with drone crashes. The total weight is approximately 650g, with a flight duration of about 8 and a half minutes. It can easily complete autonomous navigation planning tasks while balancing experimental costs and safety.
